  Goal: maintain or increase the availability of nutrients that plants need to maintain
  health and produce an abundant harvest Methods: Mimic the recylcing of organic
  matter in nature, on the farm. Understand which nutrients are leaving and replace

Cover cropping
  is growing a crop to disc into the soil that increases the soil carbon. This
  additional organic matter is feed for the millions of microbes and other
  critters that live in the soil and allows them to thrive. They in turn play a
  critical role in decomposing this plant matter and making the nutrients it
  contains available to subsequent crops.</p> <h3 id="returning-of-crop-residue-to-soil-" data-svelte-h="svelte-1fufxge">Returning of crop residue to soil:</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-a9z3tv">After harvest, we return all remaining parts of the plant back to the soil to
  become food for the soil microbiological community. This practice also results
  in increased soil carbon.</p> <h3 id="maintain-conditions-conducive-to-microbiological-health-" data-svelte-h="svelte-1usgym2">Maintain conditions conducive to microbiological health:</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-16z51ub">Maintain soil moisture, proper PH, and protection from sun and harsh weather</p> <h3 id="crop-rotation-" data-svelte-h="svelte-kd34iw">Crop rotation:</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gx4g0a">Proper crop rotation breaks up disease cycles as pests fond of a certain crop

    <ol><li>Used mainly in spring months to establish transplants and germinate
        seeds</li> <li>sometimes to pre-irrigate some fields prior to planting. This allows
        them to germinate weeds so that they can cultivate them out before
        seeding or transplanting (let them grow then kill them).</li></ol></li> <li>flood (used sparingly)
