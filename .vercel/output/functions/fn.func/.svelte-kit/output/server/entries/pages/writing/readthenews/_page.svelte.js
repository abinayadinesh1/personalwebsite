  return `<h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-ticmbz">should tech people read the news?</h1> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-uskfee">alternate title: work on what matters</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bijn7u">A lot of people, especially in the tech industry, think reading the news is a
  waste of time. It pulls time away from shipping product or reading OpenAI&#39;s
  latest blog post. Even the meditation I listen to warns me not to read the
  paper, beause of how emotionally draining it can be. They&#39;re all right, to
  some degree.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-d7ouho">But how else are you to know about humanities biggest issues, without
  listening to the people reporting on it? It seems impossible to find PMF for a
  problem you made up. On the other hand, there are millions of problems in our
  world to fix: climate change, lack of humanitarian aid, surveillance,
  renewable energy, corruption, inequitable transportation, poverty, and chronic
  disease (just to name a few). ^3</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qb9uh7">These are huge problems to take on, and some of them might need cultural and
  political movements to truly fix. However, as Dwarkesh Patel says,</p> <blockquote data-svelte-h="svelte-1euh6g2"><a href="https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel">&quot;In another sense, there’s something strange in terms of domains you think
    of as crowded and totally competitive. There are usually totally obvious
    blind spots.&quot;</a></blockquote> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1jh150y">Considering the rate of progess in technology, I predict many niche problems
  in the world actually could be solved with 2-3 years of dedicated effort. To a
  lighter degree, could hackathons for social good be more impactful if people
  knew what was happening outside of their own bubble? What if 10% of people
  working on side projects or startups wanted to find a way to help people?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1og49i1">It’s also a fair argument to say that “helping people doesn’t pay” or “there’s
  no such thing as altruism”. It definitely can’t compare to the 6-7 figure
  salary of being a ML scientist or Optimization Engineer at Amazon. But I’d
  have to argue that there’s a lot more opportunity in it than there used to be,
  and just as much risk when compared to starting a B2B Saas in today’s
  saturated markets! To get an ambitious project off the ground, it takes being
  scrappy: a few cold emails, the right people, or keeping your eyes out for
  grants. VC money trickles in this space, but there are a few (LowerCarbon,
  Founders Fund) that are willing to take on higher risks to support inventions
  for the future. Here’s a list^1 I conjured of a few I know of: lmk if you know
  any too!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-9wqocv">Here’s just one reason that should convince everyone to read the news:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-z0jzqi"><li>It doesn’t take very long! Log into The New York Times once a week, give it
    a scroll like it’s Twitter, pick the most interesting article, and skim
    through it. At the minimum it takes 4 minutes, and you will always learn
    something new.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19wqpun">Here’s two more:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-36bpgg"><li>History really does repeat itself; knowing what’s going on in the world
    helps you understand the flow of money, understand strangers, and safegaurd
    you and the people you love from disaster.</li> <li>It makes you a more educated voter. Every time voting season comes around,
    I’m always surprised that it’s here and have no idea who to vote for. This
    is the first year I’m of legal age, and instead of searching up “political
    view of candidate x” the day before the deadline and finding trashy
    publicity on everyone, I’d rather build an intuition for who my future
    leaders will be.</li> <li>Using the news to educate yourself on problems happening outside of your
    geopolitical climate might open up a world of opportunities on what to
    build, who to serve, and what powers might be in play against it.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hcgjvc">I am amazed by how fast technology moves. Last month, I was sitting in on a
  computer vision workshop at BAIR^2 and realized how much insane, sci-fi-level
  tech is being shipped (my favs were on 4D View Reconstruction, Long Range
  Point Tracking, and CLIP interpretation with text).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hp4bpz">The CS community has come so far: most papers now make their code open source
  and include github pages and documentation on how to use it!! Ready to go!!!
  As someone privileged enough to live in the heart of Silicon Valley and
  surrounded by researchers, programmers, and builders, you have the power to
  use this tech for good.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1iv3qjy">Recommendations</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19wasua">I’ve recently been blown away by The New York Time’s committment to reporting.
  Recently, they sued the US Health and Humanitarian Services for not releasing
  all their data on the current migration crisis from Central America. For every
  anecdotal story they release about the Israel-Palestine conflict, they have
  done hundreds of interviews. I once interviewed 20 farmers to iterate on a
  product I was building for soil health analysis. It took me a week, and more
  than 50 cold calls. Could you even imagine 100 interviews for one line in a
  news article? NYT has to be my favorite outlet.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11r10kl">I also recommend The Economist for these sick monthly reviews and short daily
  updates they put out about the world economy and markets. NPR is great for
  less technical, broad yet specific stories on current events.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h84hgo">ps. I’m new to following the news (nobody in my family thought it’d be more
  important that applying for internships), so my recommendations are non
  exhaustive.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gtgx5s">ps. If you want a free new york times subscription, im happy to send account
  details. It’s that important.</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-2p9syu"><li>not ready yet</li> <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4jGE5NQX2Zg_TRQ5E2hi4Ax3LTzEcMFVfOJpTk9kX8/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4jGE5NQX2Zg_TRQ5E2hi4Ax3LTzEcMFVfOJpTk9kX8/edit?usp=sharing</a></li> <li>found this list of climate related problems, organized by sector <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions">https://drawdown.org/solutions</a></li></ol>`;
