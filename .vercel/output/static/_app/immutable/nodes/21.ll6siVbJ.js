  - a better way to store poop from cows (instead of lagoons)
  - robot for saving seeds from crops
  - let us know the time frames that your land will free/exposed/not growing your main cash crop and we'll calculate the optimal cover crop to grow on your land. you get free nitrogen fixation in your soils and weed suppression, while we harvest the seeds and get to resell them (for cheaper than what currently exists on the market)
  - a new marketplace for people to buy fresh produce (cutting out a lot of the middle men, bridging producers and retail)
  - making on farm processing possible with robotics
  - WALNUT PROCESSER!
  - using lidar to scan the ground for changes in topology (to build soil water simulations)
  - better crop insurance for speciality crops
  - some sort of grant program for people to transition to regen
    - what would accelerate this process?
