  waste of time. It pulls time away from shipping product or reading OpenAI's
  latest blog post. Even the meditation I listen to warns me not to read the

  some degree.`,M,d,W=`But how else are you to know about humanities biggest issues, without
  listening to the people reporting on it? It seems impossible to find PMF for a
  problem you made up. On the other hand, there are millions of problems in our

  renewable energy, corruption, inequitable transportation, poverty, and chronic
  disease (just to name a few). ^3`,q,m,$=`These are huge problems to take on, and some of them might need cultural and
  political movements to truly fix. However, as Dwarkesh Patel says,`,z,f,ee=`<a href="https://meridian.mercury.com/dwarkesh-patel">&quot;In another sense, there’s something strange in terms of domains you think

  lighter degree, could hackathons for social good be more impactful if people

  working on side projects or startups wanted to find a way to help people?`,O,c,ne=`It’s also a fair argument to say that “helping people doesn’t pay” or “there’s
  no such thing as altruism”. It definitely can’t compare to the 6-7 figure
  salary of being a ML scientist or Optimization Engineer at Amazon. But I’d
  have to argue that there’s a lot more opportunity in it than there used to be,
  and just as much risk when compared to starting a B2B Saas in today’s
  saturated markets! To get an ambitious project off the ground, it takes being
  scrappy: a few cold emails, the right people, or keeping your eyes out for
  grants. VC money trickles in this space, but there are a few (LowerCarbon,
  Founders Fund) that are willing to take on higher risks to support inventions

    I’m always surprised that it’s here and have no idea who to vote for. This

    view of candidate x” the day before the deadline and finding trashy
    publicity on everyone, I’d rather build an intuition for who my future

  Recently, they sued the US Health and Humanitarian Services for not releasing
  all their data on the current migration crisis from Central America. For every
  anecdotal story they release about the Israel-Palestine conflict, they have
  done hundreds of interviews. I once interviewed 20 farmers to iterate on a
  product I was building for soil health analysis. It took me a week, and more
  than 50 cold calls. Could you even imagine 100 interviews for one line in a
  news article? NYT has to be my favorite outlet.`,X,I,pe=`I also recommend The Economist for these sick monthly reviews and short daily
