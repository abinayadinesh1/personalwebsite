  educated, open minded farmer. I'd like to tell a story, not describe an

    without seeing a stoplight. He rarely gets to deal with other farmers, but
    actively seeks partnerships with professors and corporations.</li> <li>A has kept a journal, which, for over the past 50 years, has recorded every
    day of farming along with changes he made that helped/hurted the farm. This
    could be recorded as an IMMENSE long term study, but as simple personal
    notes, they are really messy and don&#39;t contain much qualitative data.</li> <li>A&#39;s farm has a symbiotic relationship with a company that managees
    livestock: he lets about 4-5000 sheep graze cover crops on their farm, which
    naturally cuts them down when it comes to growing season and feeds the sheep
    with yummy grasses for half the year. It&#39;s a compleetely symbiotic
    relationship, with neither side charging the other. Such an awesome example
    of holistic management.</li>`,z,f,ae=`<strong>What is the main problem you see that prevents conventional farmers from
    going regenerative? What are the biggest hurdles?</strong><br/>The problem is the transition can&#39;t be done in piecemeal. It could
  have huge positive impacts for the environment, local community, and farmer.
  But, it&#39;s very complex because there are so many forces with vested
  interest that dont want change to occur. It can be possible to impact one
  (sector), but not another.`,U,v,re=`Universities, state, corportions, AND the CONSUMER (consumer hesitates to pay
  any more for better food) are all huge players. With relevance to a farmer,
  the main issue is "who's gonna pay the difference when the yields are
  less or the farmer can't grow as much as he transitions?".`,N,y,le=`What farmers really want is better INSURANCE. They want an umbrella to protect
  them, giving them the space to venture out and experience different ways to
  farm. Moreover, practicing regenerative agriculture isn't just having
  cover crops. Spraying pesticides all over your soil even once, will
  instantaneously revert all progress you made in cultivating soil
  microbacteria. So, it's got to be all or nothing.`,E,c,he=`There isn't a lot of data to support regen ag. Professors will kill (him)
  - but too much of research is deductive reasoning: asking questions like,
  "what is the impact of nitrogen on soil?". It's too piecemeal.`,O,g,ue=`On A farm, he considers everything. Their borders, their timing, their
  planning. Sometimes stuff he does has an impact 6 years later, which is hard
  to measure. He's curated a system that reduces inputs and lets his system
  develop naturally, using long term thinking thats impossible for farmers that
  are optimizing for crop yield, harvest by harvest.`,B,w,me=`A major problem of our system is that everything instant gratification.
  Landowners want as much money as they can every acre every year. If farmers
  aren't yielding high, the lease owners will give the land to someone else.`,D,b,de=`<strong>What is your background? Did you have any formal training in agriculture?</strong>
  This is his 50th year farming. He switched to regen ag in 1985 when he saw the
  ground was getting worse and worse. He began with just putting wheatstraw into
  the soil and was 100% serendiputous. A says he learns more from mistakes than victories,
  and it can be really hard to draw conclusions in farming: &quot;what was the factor
  that made my crop do X that year?&quot; His farms always has trials going, doing
  comparative analyses with one type of practice vs another. They almost went bankrupt,
  twice.`,F,x,pe=`He plays with the ideas of minimalism vs manipulation, which is what most
  farmers do. They sterilize the whole environment and create what you want
  through inputs, with no trust in the natural system.`,R,C,fe=`The best way to start the transition to regeneration is to get away from
  sterile environment. Try creating live roots, and add biomass. The soil and
  ground should be spongy. You don't need all the nitrogen fertilizers you
  think.`,Q,k,ve=`He started regen farming 37 years ago, and had done everything with no support
  from the state or university. With decades of initiative, he made
  relationships with professors from UCDavis, UC Berkeley, and UC Extension
  schools to share his knowledge and progress the field of regen ag.`,X,T,ye=`<strong>What is the main motivator for a farmer to start the change, from
    conventional to regen?</strong>`,Y,_,ce=`<li>Farmers need to be convinced, with all 6 of their senses, what regen ag will
    do for them. If they can see things, walk on the ground, smell the ground
    and put their shovels in to see the soil, they can start to understand.</li>`,G,H,ge=`<em>a huge surprise to me:</em> some conventional farmers dont even see worms in
  their soils. they dont remember, know, or feel what it means to have healthy, microbial
  enriched soils.`,J,L,we=`<li>farmers need to see numbers. research needs to be done that quantifies just <strong>how much</strong>
    less water, fertilizer, time, and inputs are being used. how tillage times are
    shortening and tractors run faster.
    <strong>on its own, regenerative farming doesnt increase yield, but it reduces
      the bottom line of money spent to run the farm.</strong> who cares how you make your dollar?</li>`,K,M,be=`farmers need to see hard numbers from someone they trust. It can take 3-4
  years for the ground to change, so they cant depend on the instantaneous
  result anymore.`,V,P,xe=`<strong>how bad is tilling for our soils? if so, why does it have such an extensive
    history, indicating its benefit for soil?</strong>
  With some organic/regen farms, people are throwing it out. If you only maintain
  1-acre, you can pull out weeds yourself or get volunteers to help. But it really
  matters at scale: no-till on any size is almost nonexistent.`,Z,I,Ce=`On his farm, he uses targetting tilling: only killing what you need to and
  till everything shallow (2-3 inches). A only uses tilling to a) kill weeds or
  b) make a seedbed. He doesn't depend on it, like other farmers do, for
  fertility and yields. His tractors run on the same path for 12 years, reducing
  the amount of ground getting disturbed. o make this work, he builds soil
  structure with other methods: putting compost out, biomass, and tending to the
  roots. True, weeds reduce naturally over time. Their older organic fields are
  their cleanest ones. But this isn't bulletproof; forget about insects,
  disease, and fertility: A's biggest spend is on weeds, and is the only
  thing holding them back from going no-till.`,$,q,ke=`<strong>*Quick reflection</strong>: These write-ups are to make my
