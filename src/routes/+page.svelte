  im currently interested in using robotics to bring agency and utility to
  farmers by developing low cost methods of on-farm processing. broadly, I'm
  curious about how to shorten the overall food supply chain, make small farmers
  competitive on the market, and leverage policy and sustainability for long
  term goals in public health.

  in the past, I did research at <a href="https://www.columbiactcn.org/"
    >Columbia under Vilas Menon</a

  <a href="https://www.einsteinmed.edu/centers/ictr/health-data-innovations/"
    >Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a
  >, and
  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668883"
    >science fair projects</a
  > to improve diagnosis processes using eye tracking.

  i'm currently studying a mixture of agriculture, computer science, and
  mathematics at uc berkeley 🧸. this semester is spent conquering my fears (of
  falling from 60m up onto rope, writing long math proofs, and starting a
  startup).
