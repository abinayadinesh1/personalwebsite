    im currently interested in using robotics to bring agency and utility to
    farmers by developing visual navigation systems that can explore and
    understand diverse cropping systems. broadly, I'm curious about how to
    shorten the overall food supply chain, make small farmers competitive on the
    market, and leverage policy and sustainability for long term goals in public
    health.

    in the past, I did research at <a href="https://www.columbiactcn.org/"
      >Columbia under Vilas Menon</a
    >, data science at the
    <a href="https://www.einsteinmed.edu/centers/ictr/health-data-innovations/"
      >Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a
    >, and
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668883"

    i'm currently studying a mixture of agriculture, computer science, and
    mathematics at uc berkeley 🧸. this semester is spent conquering my fears
    (of falling from 60m up onto rope, writing long math proofs, and starting a
    startup).
