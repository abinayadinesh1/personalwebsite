  <h1>why do economies at scale break down with agriculture?</h1>
  <h2>tldr;</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      everyone says economies og scale helps buisinesses boom and are usually
      more efficient: if you can up your production and distribute your goods
      better, you will make more money and use it to grow.
    </li>
    <li>
      maybe thie works- maybe conventional agriculture is actually a prime
      example of this. it uses machines to make more goods, increase shelf life
      + distribute it farther, and has more profit to reinvest in machines and
      land.
    </li>
    <li>but maybe, this doesn't actually work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    central thesis of economies of scale is its cheaper to build something at
    higher volume (considering net profit) the fixed cost is how it takes to
    build 1 unit. the more you can build with that one cost, the larger your
    window of return. leads us to an important point: the more you can sell your
    product, the more you can actually invest in making the product better.
    start with a shit product, but if your even a bit profitable, the more you
    can sell the better you can make the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    in normal agriculture, start with a product: like Tomato. you can only sell
    lots of Tomato if you can make lots of Tomato. the only way is if you have
    lots of land, which requires either lots of feet or lots of machinery to
    plant, weed, fertilize, water, and harvest. so, buy a tractor, build a
    processing factory, make synthetic fertilizers to shorten growing cycles.
    conventional agriculture has grown to <a
      href="https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/food/us-food-system-factsheet"
      >feed over 65% of our country</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    and according to the world bank, they account for 70 - 90 percent of
    increases in food production. ALL OF THE SURPLUS OF FOOD THAT WE HAVE IS
    BECAUSE OF CONVENTIONAL AG. without a surplus (meaning you make more food
    than you can eat yourself), we wouldn&#39;t have cities, writing, philosphy,
    art, robotics, computers, and more. (cities were actually created from
    division of space and labor: we intensified farming practices so we could
    grow more food on less land with less people and send people to highly
    concentrated towns/cities so its easier for us to transport goods to them)
    (suburbs were built much much later, and are only possible if you have
    really effective transportation).
  </p>
  <p>
    obviously, conventional agriculture is pivotal to us being here. and do they
    benefit from economies of scale? obviously. You can only grow so much Tomato
    if you are farming 12/36 months of a 3 year cycle. But, if you fertilize
    every year, that turns into 24/36 months of the year.
  </p>
  <p>why doesn&#39;t this work for agriculture?</p>
  <p>where do economies of scale break down?</p>
  <p>
    worldwide, “With over 70% of the world’s food production reliant on family
    farmers, this type of farming represents the vast majority of agriculture
    worldwide, both in developed and developing countries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Large-scale family farms and industrial nonfamily farms account for only
      5% of farms, but 63.8% of production (in $). Small-scale family farms
      represent 89% of U.S. farms, but only 17.8% of production.4
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fixed costs can also often be thought of as <em>setup</em> costs - steps that
    need to take place at the beginning of a process. The longer your process runs,
    the more those costs get spread out.
  </p>
  <p>over time, then you reach this cost cliff.</p>
  <p>
    deeconomies of scale: the features that lead to an increase in average costs
    as a business grows beyond a certain size. not just as it grows beyond a
    certain size, but as it grows over a certain TIME PERIOD. you cant grow on a
    single piece of land with the ideals of economies at scale for over 100
    years - after a certain point, the amount you need to spend on fertilizer,
    disease management, water (due to drought/less water holding capacity of the
    soil). <strong
      >after a certain time period, the economy of scale actually fails +
      further production leads to lower costs.</strong
    >
    because of international markets, growing of cash crops, and markets FAR from
    feeding people, conventional agriculture can continue to make money. but we are
    doing quite poorly at the job of feeding people.

    </li>
    <li>
      reach a cost cliff: you&#39;ve fucked over the land you&#39;re on that it
      costs so much to farm on it (increased water, fertilizer, and pesticide
      costs)
    </li>
    <li>DIP</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    move to another place and start again what this actually looks like is
    consolidation: big companies can&#39;t produce well on the land theyre on so
    they buy land from smaller farmers or acquire smaller farms, industrialize
    those processes, and do the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    do this n times and you have plowed, then deserted all the land in the
    world. at times, you have made insane quanities of food. but now, once
    you&#39;ve run out of physical space, what next? shipping fertile soil from
    mars? extreme poverty around the world?
