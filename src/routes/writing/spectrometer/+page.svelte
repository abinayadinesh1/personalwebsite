  we are splitting electromagnetic radiation into its individual wavelengths

<p>
  an electromagnetic spectrum is made up of electromagnetic radiation, with
  varying frequency. each frequency has an associate wavelength, which has its
  own photon energy.
</p>
<p>which section of a electromagnetic spectrum does spectroscopy work on?</p>
<p>
  the electromagnetic spectrum can be organized by defining specific frequency
  ranges as bands that correlate to how those waves are produced, interact with
  matter, and are formed. this is what we see as <a

  energy - photons used for work ? wavelength is actually based on frequency.
</p>
<p>what has energy here? what is electromagnetic radiation?</p>
<p>
  the electromagnetic FIELD (not spectrum anymore) is made up of waves with
  specific characteristics, like being able to propogate freely in space without
  needing added input (also why its called the far field, it can move a great
  distance away from the source that produced it). they carry momentum and
  electromagnetic radiant energy.

<p>light is both a particle and a wave</p>

    mass spec - takes a gas and is able to measure the spectrum of masses of all
    the gases/particles
    <ul>
      <li>
        tells you the <strong>mass to charge ratio of ions</strong> which allows
        you to know exactly what the chemical composition is of what you are looking
        at
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    optical spectrometer - is able to separate the unique wavelengths that make
    up visible light
    <ul>
      <li>
        can only work on specific sections of the electromagnetic spectrum
        (probably the part to the right and left of the visible spectrum)

        uses a beam of light (like a laser) to excite a bunch of photons and
        create raman scattering
      </li>

        how much the resulting photons shift up or down decides what the

</ul>
<p>how this worked:</p>
<p>
  make a completely black box (to absorb any light not coming from the light
  source)
</p>
<p>make a box with a tiny slit in the front for which light can enter from</p>
<p>
  put a webcam in the box and connect it to a camera, place a diffraction
  grating on it (like a cd) which takes light and diffracts it based on the
  wavelength
</p>
<p>
  shine light into the box, it will hit the diffraction grating and scatter into
  individual wavelengths of EMR which will show up in the image the webcam
  produces.
</p>
<p>
  you convert the image into wavelengths using opencv + a simple script
  (attached)
</p>
<p>
  to look at the wavelengths/compositions of certain media, can pass it through
  a clear box of that liquid

<p>measure chemical composition of air</p>
<p>
  when you are trying to measure things you cant see on the visible eye, you
  have to use something longer or shorter to fix the wavelength.
</p>
<p>
  a visible light beam (like a laser) will still interact with the particles,
  but only ones within a specific frequency range. <strong
    >ER source and particle you are looking for must be in the same frequency
    range?</strong

</p>
<p>do diffraction graters differ depending on the light source and sample?</p>
<p>
  GREENHOUSE GASES (characteristically) ABSORB INFRARED. they trap heat energy
  that would otherwise leave as infrared light.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >greenhouse gases take infrared light emitted as a result of chemical
    reactions and absorb it, keeping heat in the atmosphere that otherwise would
    have left.</strong

<p>agriculture, climate</p>
<p>
  how much carbon is ur farm sequestering? low quality because we dont know what
  form/how long. we only know flux.
</p>
<p>
  better way to measure is by sampling for carbon in the soil - through
  fractionation, we can tell what forms/pools its in, but fractionation assays
  are so EXPENSIVE
</p>
<p>small experiment could be measuring carbon flux through a medium</p>
<p>then measuring it through soil</p>
<p>then being able to quantify net in and net out</p>
<p>
  aka making a <strong>Gas Analyzer Spectrometer</strong> or any
  <strong>infrared analyzer</strong>

  ai, quantum computing for climate analysis, gas analysis, gas flux,
  spectroscopy, precision agriculture, etc.
